								<p><strong>The recurring adversities brought along by winters in north India wreak havoc across the northern belt causing a large number of deaths due to exposure to fatal low temperatures. Over the last two decades the death toll in the northern part of the country has been consistently increasing during the winter months. According to the Centre for Holistic Development, 279 people died in December 2014 following 225 deaths in November in Delhi alone. Almost 80 percent of the unidentified dead bodies are homeless which is bound to happen in a city that is estimated to have over 55,000 homeless people. So many more people that live in the slums are not equipped to deal with the winters and are the most vulnerable to harsh winds.</strong></p>
								<p>Despite the sincere efforts of the Supreme Court to provide shelters with adequate provisions, the state governments have failed to construct the required number of shelters in the country. There is a huge disparity in the number of sanctioned shelters and the number of actual shelters being constructed across India. The Supreme Court took notice of the terrible conditions of the homeless in January 2010 when it directed the Delhi Government to construct shelter houses immediately to curb the number of winter deaths.</p>
								<p class="article__text-filled text-filled">The State’s negligence towards the establishment of life-saving shelters is unforgivable in circumstances where we have so many people sleeping in market corridors, bus stands, railway stations and places of worship while being constantly exposed to heat, cold, diseases and malnutrition. The homeless lose lives in large numbers but are unaccounted for.</p>
								
								<p>Majority of the bodies are never claimed and causes of death are never investigated. So many of these “invisible” men and women contribute to our nation as cheap labour but have no access to elementary services like health, food, water, education and sanitation. It is of prime importance to cater to the needs of the poor especially when there is enough impetus by the Central Government. </p>
